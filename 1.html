                        A front-end developer is a type of software developer who specializes in creating and designing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of websites and web applications. The primary responsibility of a front-end developer is to ensure that the visual and interactive aspects of a website or application are user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and functionally efficient.

                        Fundamentally a front-end developer, historically sometimes referred to as a client-side developer, produces the code sent from a web server to a client/front-end to establish a user interface. For example, when you load a webpage into a web browser, code is sent from a web server to the device/client requesting the page. The code sent will produce the user interface one sees in the web browser. This code is considered front-end code and is a mixture of the web technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        
                        An individual typically enters into the field of front-end development by first learning to build a simple website using HTML and CSS. HTML or HyperText Markup Language is likened to the structural framing of a house, while CSS or Cascading Style Sheets can be considered the finishing touches one sees once a home is complete.
                        
                        Eventually, the house (i.e., a website) will need to become automated. In other words, it will need to become interactive and respond to events orchestrated by the user or the device on which it runs (e.g., on click or on load do X). To accomplish this, front-end developers learn the JavaScript programming language and use this language and the Document Object Model (aka the DOM) to add dynamic and interactive aspects to HTML and CSS.
                        
                        As a front-end developer progresses in their career, they will move from a simple understanding of web pages and websites to potentially a robust grasp of software development practices as it is done on the web platform using the JavaScript programming language.

                        Front-end developers work with various technologies, tools, and languages, including:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard markup language used to create the structure and layout of web pages.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A stylesheet language used to control the presentation, formatting, and appearance of web pages, such as colors, fonts, and layout.
JavaScript: A programming language that allows developers to add interactivity, animations, and other dynamic elements to websites and web applications.
Front-end developers may also use libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js, to streamline their work and create more sophisticated and interactive UIs. Additionally, they often collaborate with back-end developers, who are responsible for the server-side logic and data management, to ensure seamless integration between the front-end and back-end components of a web application or website.

HTML, CSS, & JavaScript:
A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications using web technologies (i.e., HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript), which run on the Open Web Platform or act as compilation input for non-web platform environments (i.e., React Native).



Typically, a person enters into the field of front-end development by learning to develop HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which commonly runs in a web browser but can also run in a headless browser, or as compilation input for a native runtime environment.</div>
